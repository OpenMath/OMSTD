# The OpenMath Standard (starting with OpenMath 2)

This repository contains the sources and build system for the OpenMath 2 standard. The
repository is a copy of the original version in the
[OpenMath SVN repository](https://github.com/OpenMath/OMSVN), specifically 
[www/standard/om20-2004-06-30](https://github.com/OpenMath/OMSVN/tree/master/www/standard/om20-2004-06-30).

To build it, just run `source ./run` on top-level. If you have `trang.jar`, `rxp`, and
`saxon9h2.jar` installed, this should build the standard for you.
